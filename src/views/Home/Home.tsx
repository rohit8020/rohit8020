              Hello there! I am a recent graduate from Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, specializing in Information Technology. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in various aspects of web development.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="flex space-x-2">

              <p>
              During my time as a full-stack intern, I primarily focused on backend development. I had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js and Express.js to build and consume RESTful APIs. Additionally, I utilized MongoDB to design and implement efficient data models for the projects I worked on.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="flex space-x-2">
              <p>ðŸŸ¤</p>
              <p>
              One of the notable projects I contributed to was a trading platform. This platform involved real-time updates to market data, customer management, and order placement. Furthermore, I was involved in the development of a CRM system that included lead management, customer tracking, and sales forecasting. I also had the chance to work on a trading platform with course management and tracking features.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="flex space-x-2">
              <p>ðŸŸ¤</p>
              <p>
              Throughout my internships, I consistently delivered results by developing new features and resolving bugs within tight deadlines. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I actively contributed to enhancing the overall code quality of three projects.

              <p>
              In addition to my academic and professional experience, I am also an avid competitive programmer. I enjoy participating in coding competitions and solving algorithmic challenges. This passion for competitive programming has honed my problem-solving skills, strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and taught me to write efficient and optimized code.

              <p>
              I am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions and enhance user experiences. With my solid foundation in web development and dedication to continuous learning, I am excited to embark on new professional opportunities and contribute to the ever-evolving field of Information Technology.
